## How to overlay heatmap onto cell culture 

Requirements: 

- gimp 
- heatmap photos (usually in png but other formats are okay)
- MEA culture photos (usually in TIF)

Steps: 

- Open Gimp 
- Go to open, select heatmap photo 
- Go to open again, select MEA photo, it should open in a new window 
- MEA photo may be dark, if so, go to colour --> contrast and brightness, usually a value of 120 for contrast and 120 for brightness will do the job, but play around with those values to make sure
- right click on the MEA photo --> edit --> copy 
- go to the heatmap window and paste on top 
- rotate -90 (make sure that electrode 15 is on the left mid area). Rotation can be done by using the rotate tool 
- adjust opacity
- scale by using the scale tool 
- change the mode of the overaly, usually "soft light", "overlay", or "hard light" does the job quite well. "hard light" might be slightly better because it shows the cells more...)(but then the heatmap is more affected than in the case of soft light) but some cropping will have to be done... but I suppose at this stage we don't have to get into that yet (but for publishing we will have to)
